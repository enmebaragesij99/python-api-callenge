# python-api-challenge

This is my Python api challenge which consists of: 

Part 1:WeatherPy-demonstrating the relationship between latitude and different weather variables(Temperature, Humidity,
CLoudiness, Windspeed) and the linear regression to go along with each relationship seperated by Northern and Southern Hemisphere.

Part 2:VacationPy-planning a future vacation, firstly, creating a map to display every city, then narrowing it down to my ideal weather condition, 
and finally, finding the first hotel within the first hotel of the coordinates of the city.

Note;analysis for linear regression in Part 1 is included in jupyter notebook below each graph, each relationship graph(first four graphs)is also been saved in output_data folder and  the csv file used along with the jupyter python code for each part is inside the WeatherPy folder.
